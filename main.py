Advanced ML-Enhanced Test Failure Prediction Framework
Research-Grade Prototype for University of Tokyo Masters Application

Author: Harrison King
Institution: University of Kent Canterbury
Research Area: Leveraging Machine Learning to Improve Automated Software Testing

This project explores how machine learning can help us predict when automated tests
might fail, reducing the time developers spend fixing broken test suites. The approach
combines traditional ML techniques with deep learning to analyze patterns in test
execution history and code changes.

The main idea: instead of just running tests and hoping they pass, we can use historical
data to predict which tests are likely to fail and why. This helps teams focus their
maintenance efforts where they're needed most.
